# weatherbot
A Slackbot that pulls the weather forecast from openweather

2018.06.02 - it doesn't work for slack yet, you can run this from the command line, though.
Usage: ./get_the_weather.py '<location, state>' 'C|F' 'current|brief|full'
(for <location, state> you can do something like 'New York, NY' or 'Dublin, IR')
